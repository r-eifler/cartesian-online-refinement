;; Problem to test issue75. If we add the implied preconditions, the
;; preprocessor cannot prune any variables; if we do, it can prune lots.
;;
;; This is based on Trucks-Strips #1, with the following modifications:
;;
;; - Removed everything pertaining to packages 2 and 3.
;; - Removed atom (foo).
;; - Changed goal deadline from t3 to t2.
;; - Removed storage space (if that's what it is) a2.
