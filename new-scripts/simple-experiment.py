## Factory for experiments.
##
## Parses cmd-line options to decide whether this is a gkigrid
## experiment, a local experiment or whatever, and what the name
## of the experiment (the *.q file etc.) should be.
##
## Also parses options to override the default values for sharding
## (how many tasks to group into one top-level directory) and
## grouping (how many runs to put into one task).
##
## Maybe also parses some generic options that make sense for all
## kinds of experiments, e.g. timeout and memory limit.

experiment.add_resource("PLANNER", "../downward/search/release-search",
                        "release-search")
## Includes a "global" file, i.e., one needed for all runs, into the
## experiment archive. In case of GkiGridExperiment, copies it to the
## main directory of the experiment. The name "PLANNER" is an ID for
## this resource that can also be used to refer to it in shell scripts.

        ## before the main command, i.e., outside the part for which we
        ## restrict runtime and memory. For example, post-processing
        ## could be used to rename result files or zipping them up. The
        ## postprocessing code should have some way of finding out

        ## environment variable.

        ## There's a corresponding declare_required_output for output
        ## files that must be present at the end or we have an error. A
        ## specification like this is e.g. necessary for the Argo
        ## cluster. On the gkigrid, this wouldn't do anything, although
        ## the declared outputs should be stored somewhere so that we
        ## can later verify that all went according to plan.
